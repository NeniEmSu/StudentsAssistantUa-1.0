# StudentsAssistantUa

This site was made for the exam practice for the December 2018 TDMU medical exams

I used php, javascript, bootstrap and basic markup and stying to get it all done.
At this moment its live on www.testpractice.studentsassistantua.com

### What i learnt in the course of this project

1. I created a basic login & signup script in php while learning the basics of the language
2. Made a not so efficient test practice app with javascript instead of on the back end with php cause my php knowledge and sql was not to per and i frankly didn't have the time to learn while coding given the 1 month deadline to my exams.
3. learnt the basics of Sql and mysql to implement the databases i used.
