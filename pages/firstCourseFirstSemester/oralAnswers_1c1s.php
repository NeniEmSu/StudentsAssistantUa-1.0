            <p>The electronic structure of atom.<br>
                Electrons in the atom are groupe around the nuceluns into shells. The Faither a Shell is from the nucleus, the Langer it is, the more elctrons it can hold,and the highter are energies of those electrons.<br>
                1st Shell- 2 electrons (s)<br>
                2nd Shell- 8 electrons (s.p)<br>
                3nd Shell-18 electrons (s,p,d)<br>
                4th Shell- 32 electrons (s,p,d,f)<br>
                Within each subshell, electrons are groupe into ORBITALS- region of space within an atom where the specific electrons are most likely to be found. <br>
                The electronic configuration of atoms.<br>
                ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATION-a distribution of electrons into different levels, sublevels and orbital of an atom.<br>
                EXCEPTIONAL ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATION-tendency of the subshells to be exactly half-filed or completely filled.<br>
                HUND&rsquo;S RULE-every orbital In a subshell is a singly occupied with one electron before any one orbital is doubly occupied,, and all electrons In singly occupied orbitals have the same spin. <br>
                THE PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE-the states that tw&oacute;j identical particles with half-integer spin cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. </p>

            <p>THE PERIODIC LAW-when the elements are arranged In order of increasing atomic mass,certain sets of properties recur periodically. <br>
                The size of atoms and the size of ions: <br>
                *the atoms Get bigger as you go down groupslodding extra layers of electrons.<br>
                *atoms Get smaller as ypu go cross a peroid<br>
                *ions aren&rsquo;t the same size as atoms they came from:<br>
                -positive ions are smaller than the atoms the came from<br>
                -negative ions are bigger than the atoms they came from<br>
                IONIZATION POTENTIAL-is the energy necessary to remove an elektron from the neutral atom. It generalny increases acrtoss row on the periodic maximum for the noble gases chich have closed shells. <br>
                ELECTRON AFFINITY- is definied as the change In generalny (in KJ/mol)of a neutral atom when an electron is attend to the atom to form a negative Ion. In Rother words, the neutral atom&rsquo;s likehood of gaining an elektron.<br>
                THE ELECTRONEGATIVITY- is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attracy a bonding pair of the electorns. The Pauling scal eis the most commonly used. Fluorine(the most electronegative elements) is assignedca value of 4.0 and values range down to caesium chich is the east electronegative of 0.7.</p>

            <p>CHEMICAL BOND- a mutal attraction betweeen two atoms resulting from a redistribution of their outer electrons. The three types of chemical bonds are ionic bond, covalent bonds and polar covalent bonds. <br>
                THE COVALENT BOND- is characterized by sparing of pair of electrons between atoms and others covalent bonds.<br>
                THE NON-COVALENT BOND- the electrons are equally shared.<br>
                IONIC BOND- is a type of chemical Bond that involves a metal and a non-metal Ion through electrostatic affraction. Also we can recognize metal lic Bond-force that holds atoms together In a metal lic substancje and hydrogen bonds.<br>
                BOND ENERGY- the energy required to break the Bond between two covalently Bondem atoms.<br>
                BOND LENGHT- the overage distance between the nuclei of two bonded atoms.<br>
                POLARITY- is a physical property of compounds which relate to other physical properties, such as melting and boiling points or solubility. Bond polarities arise from bonds between atoms of different electronegativity. A molecule can be ionic, polar or non-polar.<br>

            <p><b>4. The method of molecular orbitals in the form of LSAO-MO.</b> </p>

            <p>In chemistry, molecular orbital (MO) theory is a method for determining molecular structure in which electrons are not assigned to individual bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the nuclei in the whole molecule.<br>
                Molecular orbital (MO) theory uses a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) to represent molecular orbitals resulting from bonds between atoms. <br>
                A linear combination of atomic orbitals or LCAO is a quantum superposition of atomic orbitals and a technique for calculating molecular orbitals in quantum chemistry.[1] In quantum mechanics, electron configurations of atoms are described as wavefunctions <br>
                These are often divided into bonding orbitals, anti-bonding orbitals, and non-bonding orbitals. A bonding orbital concentrates electron density in the region between a given pair of atoms, so that its electron density will tend to attract each of the two nuclei toward the other and hold the two atoms together.[15] An anti-bonding orbital concentrates electron density &quot;behind&quot; each nucleus (i.e. on the side of each atom which is farthest from the other atom), and so tends to pull each of the two nuclei away from the other and actually weaken the bond between the two nuclei. Electrons in non-bonding orbitals tend to be associated with atomic orbitals that do not interact positively or negatively with one another, and electrons in these orbitals neither contribute to nor detract from bond strength.[15]<br>
                Molecular orbitals are further divided according to the types of atomic orbitals they are formed from. Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration(electron cloud shape) and by energy levels.<br>
                The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams.</p>

            <p><b>5. Energy diagram of diatomic homonuclear molecules.</b></p>

            <p>A molecular orbital diagram, or MO diagram, is a qualitative descriptive tool explaining chemical bonding in molecules in terms of molecular orbital theory in general and the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) molecular orbital method in particular. MO diagrams can explain why some molecules exist and others do not. They can also predict bond strength, as well as the electronic transitions that can take place.<br>
                We start reading the diagram from the bottom because this is how MO diagrams are constructed. <br>
                First, we have the 1s + 1s -> sigma bonding MO, and then above this the &#963;* (sigma star) antibonding MO.<br>
                Then, there are the pair 2s + 2s bonding &#963; (sigma) and antibonding &#963;* (sigma star) MOs.<br>
                Next we come to the p + p interactions. These are a little more complicated because p orbitals are orientated in space along the x, y and z dimensions.<br>
                The 2px + 2px orbital interaction gives a &#963; (sigma) bonding MO.<br>
                The 2py + 2py and 2pz + 2pz interactions are equivalent, they only differ in spatial orientation. Both give rise to &#960; bonding MOs.<br>
                Next come a pair of &#960;* (pi-star) antibonding MOs.<br>
                Finally, we have the 2px + 2px &#963;* (sigma star) antibonding MO.</p>

            <p><b>6. The concept of biogenic elements. The content of bioelements in the human body. Macroelements, microelements and ultramicroelements. The concept of Fenton-metals.</b></p>

            <p>Almost every one of the chemical elements plays some role in Earth&rsquo;s living systems, as well as human body. Biogenic elements are divided into: <br>
                six major biogenic elements (elements found in almost all of Earth's living systems, often in relatively large quantities); <br>
                five minor biogenic elements (elements found in many of Earth's living systems, and/or in relatively small quantities); <br>
                trace elements (essential elements necessary only in very small quantities to maintain the chemical reactions on which life depends, or elements found only a very few of Earth's living systems). However bioelements are divided into macro, micro and ultramicroelements. <br>
                The levels of macroelements in bodily fluids and tissues exceed 1 &#956;g/g of wet tissue (&#956;g &ndash; one millionth part of a gram &ndash; 10-6 g) <br>
                Macroelements include: chlorine (Cl) phosphorus (P) magnesium (Mg) potassium (K) sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) <br>
                The levels of microelements (trace elements) in the organism are below 1 &#956;g/g of wet tissue. Microelements include: germanium (Ge) boron (B) chromium (Cr) tin (Sn) zinc (Zn) fluorine (F) iodine (I) cobalt (Co) silicon (Si) lithium (Li) manganese (Mn) <br>
                In biochemistry, an ultramicroelements are chemical elements that normally comprises less than one microgram per gram of a given organism (i.e. less than 0.0001% by weight), but which plays a significant role in its metabolism. <br>
                Possible ultratrace elements in humans include boron, silicon, nickel, vanadium and cobalt. Other possible ultratrace elements in other organisms include bromine, cadmium, fluorine, lead, lithium, and tin. Possible ultratrace elements in humans include boron, silicon, nickel and cobalt. Other possible elements in other organisms include bromine, cadmium, fluorine, lead, lithium, and tin. </p>

            <p>Qualitative chemical analysis, deals with the identification of elements or grouping of elements present in a sample. The techniques employed in qualitative analysis vary in complexity, depending on the nature of the sample. In some cases it is necessary only to verify the presence of certain elements or groups for which specific tests applicable directly to the sample.More often the sample is a complex mixture, and a systematic analysis must be made in order that all the constituents may be identified. It is customary to classify the methods into two classes: qualitative inorganic analysis and qualitative organic analysis. <br>
                &bull;calcium ion: Ca2+(aq) + 2OH&ndash;(aq) ==> Ca(OH)2(s) gives a white precipitate of calcium hydroxide with sodium hydroxide IF the concentration of calcium ion is high. It is not soluble in excess of NaOH. No precipitate is formed with ammonia solution. <br>
                &bull;magnesium ion: Mg2+(aq) + 2OH&ndash;(aq) ==> Mg(OH)2(s) gives a white precipitate of magnesium hydroxide with ammonia or sodium hydroxide, which is not soluble in excess of either NH3 or NaOH. You could distinguish Mg from Ca with a flame test or ammonia test above. <br>
                &bull;iron(II) ion: Fe2+(aq) + 2OH&ndash;(aq) ==> Fe(OH)2(s) gives a dark green precipitate of iron(II) hydroxide with ammonia or sodium hydroxide, which is not soluble in excess of NH3 or NaOH. Darkens in air due to oxidation to Fe(OH)3. <br>
                &bull;iron(III) ion: Fe3+(aq) + 3OH&ndash;(aq) ==> Fe(OH)3(s) forms a brown precipitate of iron(III) hydroxide with ammonia or sodium hydroxide, which is not soluble in excess of NH3 or NaOH. <br>
                Another test for iron(III) ions is to add a few drops of potassium/ammonium thiocyanate solution and a blood&ndash;red coloured compound is formed. <br>
                &bull;Chloride Ion Test. When a solution of silver nitrate is added to a solution containing chloride ions and nitric acid, a heavy bluish white precipitate of silver chloride forms. The equation for the reaction is: Ag+(aq) + Cl-(aq) &rarr; AgCl(s) White precipitate <br>
                &bull;Phosphate Ion Test. When a solution containing phosphate ions is heated with a solution of ammonium molybdate [(NH4)2MoO4] and dilute nitric acid a bright yellow precipitate of ammonium phosphomolybdate [(NH4)3PO4 &bull; 12MoO4] is formed. The yellow precipitate is extremely insoluble in nitric acid. <br>
                &bull;Cooper In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of organs and metabolic processes. The human body has complex homeostatic mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. Copper deficiency and toxicity can be either of genetic or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's genetic diseases, which are the focus of intense international research activity, has shed insight into how human bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential micronutrient. <br>
                &bull;Manganese is an important metal for human health, being absolutely necessary for development, metabolism, and the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and parkinsonian-like symptoms. Extensive work has been carried out to understand Mn-induced neurotoxicity and to find an effective treatment. This review focuses on the requirement for Mn in human health as well as the diseases associated with excessive exposure to this metal. <br>
                &bull;Mercury (chemical symbol Hg) is a heavy metal which occurs in several forms, all of which can produce toxic effects in high enough doses.Mercury poisoning can result in several diseases, including acrodynia (pink disease), Hunter-Russell syndrome, and Minamata disease (birth defect). It damages the central nervous system, endocrine system, kidneys, and other organs, and adversely affects the mouth, gums, and teeth.</p>

                    provinces (areas of natural deficiency or excess of certain chemicals elements in the lithosphere).</b></p>

            <p>An endemic disease is a disease that is always present in a certain population or region. One of the most talked about endemic diseases is malaria. Malaria is such a fixture in certain parts of Africa that a protective mutation - sickle cell trait - has become common in local populations. Maralia is an infectious disease endemic to Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasites belonging to the Plasmodium genus and are transmitted via the bite of an infected female mosquito. African sleeping sickening is a medical condition caused by protozoan parasites belonging the Trypanosoma genus. These parasites are transmitted via the bite of an infected tsetse fly. Chagas disease is caused by an infection with Trypanosma cruzi, a protozoan parasite that is transmitted via the feces of the triatomine insect, a natural vector for the parasite, Trypanosma cruzi. Chagas disease is endemic in Mexico, South and Central America. </p>

            <p><b>9. Free radical processes in the body.</b></p>

            <p>Free radicals are toxic byproducts of oxygen metabolism that can cause significant damage to living cells and tissues in a process called &quot;oxidative stress.&quot; The vitamins and minerals the body uses to counteract oxidative stress are called antioxidants. The body is under constant attack from oxidative stress. Oxygen in the body splits into single atoms with unpaired electrons. Electrons like to be in pairs, so these atoms, called free radicals, scavenge the body to seek out other electrons so they can become a pair. This causes damage to cells, proteins and DNA. <br>
                Though free radicals are a normal byproduct of oxygen metabolism, certain environmental and behavioral risks dramatically increase the number of free radicals in the body, which in turn dramatically increases the oxidative stress on the body. Cigarette smoking is the most potent free radical generator in the body. Even one or two puffs sends the amount of oxidative stress on your body soaring. Environmental pollution, fried foods and charcoal broiled meats also increase oxidative stress. The resulting increase in free radicals can disrupt cell membranes, increase the risk of many forms of cancer and damage the interior lining of blood vessels, leading to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>

            <p><b>10. Complex compounds. The Werner theory. The nature of chemical bond in compounds. Classification of complex compounds.</b></p>

            <p>Complex compounds. Classification of complex compounds.<br>
                Coordination compounds are the compounds in which the central metal atom is linked to &#1072; number of ions or neutral molecules by coordinate bonds i.&#1077;. by donation of lone pairs of electrons by these ions or neutral molecules to the central metal atom &#1077;.g. nickel tetracarbonyl, [Ni(CO)4] in which CO molecules are linked to the central nickel atom by coordinate bonds by donating lone pairs of electrons. If the species formed by linking of &#1072; number of ions or molecules by co-ordinate bonds to the central metal atom (or ion) carries positive or negative charge, it is called a complex ion, &#1077;.g. [Fe(&#1057;N)6]4- , [Cu(NH3)4]2+, [Ag(CN)2]- etc. Types of complex compounds There are following three types of complexes: <br>
                (1) &#1040; complex in which the complex ion carries &#1072; net positive charge is called cationic complex, <br>
                (2) &#1040; complex in which the complex ion carries &#1072; net negative charge is called anionic complex, <br>
                (3) &#1040; complex carrying no net charge is called &#1072; neutral complex or simply &#1072; complex.</p>

            <p>The Werner&rsquo;s theory.<br>
                In 1893, Werner was the first to propose correct structures for coordination compounds containing complex ions , in which a central transition metal atom is surrounded by neutral or anionic ligands .<br>
                CoCl3&bull;6NH3 (This type of representation does not implies any proper geometry around the central metal ion)</p>

            <p>The basic postulates of Werner's theory may be summerised as follows:<br>
                &#61623;Metal possess two types of valency:<br>
                a.The primary or principal valency; this is the ionisable valency<br>
                e.g. In [Co(NH3)5Cl]2+, Co has primary valency +3 and in [Ni(CO)4], Ni has primary valency 0.<br>
                Werner's primary valence corresponds to the oxidation state.<br>
                b.A secondary nonionizable valency<br>
                &#61623;Every metal has a fixed number of secondary valency<br>
                Werner's secondary valence is always called coordination number.<br>
                &#61623;Primary valences are satisfied by negative ions whereas the secondary valences are satisfied by negative ions as well as neutral molecule or cations .<br>
                &#61623;The secondary valences are directed in space around the central metal ion in definite geometrical disposition.</p>

            <p>The nature of chemical bond in compounds.<br>
                Covalent bond: bond in which one or more pairs of electrons are shared by two atoms. <br>
                Polar covalent bond: covalent bond in which the sharing of the electron pair is unequal, with the electrons spending more time around the more nonmetallic atom.<br>
                Ionic bond: bond in which one or more electrons from one atom are removed and attached to another atom, resulting in positive and negative ions which attract each other.<br>
                Hydrogen bond: differs from other uses of the word &ldquo;bond&rdquo; since it is a force of attraction between a hydrogen atom in one molecule and a small atom of high electronegativity in another molecule. When hydrogen atoms are joined in a polar covalent bondwith a small atom of high electronegativity such as O, F or N, the partial positive charge on the hydrogen is highly concentrated because of its small size. If the hydrogen is close to another oxygen, fluorine or nitrogen in another molecule, then there is a force of attraction termed a dipole-dipole interaction. This attraction or &quot;hydrogen bond&quot; can have about 5% to 10% of the strength of a covalent bond.</p>

            <p><b>11. Chemical properties of complex compounds. Constant dissociation of<br>
                    complex compounds.</b></p>

            <p>Coordination compounds generally display a variety of distinctive chemical properties, such as an ability to undergo&#160;oxidation-reduction reactions, and catalytic activity. One of the most important properties of metallic elements is their ability to act as Lewis acids that form complexes with a variety of Lewis bases. A metal complex consists of a central metal atom or ion that is bonded to one or more ligands, which are ions or molecules that contain one or more pairs of electrons that can be shared with the metal. Electrically charged metal complexes are sometimes called complex ions. A coordination compound contains one or more metal complexes. Many industrial catalysts are metal complexes, and such catalysts are steadily becoming more important as a way to control reactivity. Transition-metal complexes are essential in biochemistry. Examples include hemoglobin, an iron complex that transports oxygen in our blood; cytochromes, iron complexes that transfer electrons in our cells; and complexes of Fe, Zn, Cu, and Mo that are crucial components of certain enzymes, the catalysts for all biological reactions. Dissociation constant - Kd.</p>

In this form of&#160;chemotherapy, popular drugs include&#160;cisplatin&#160;and&#160;carboplatin, but several have been proposed or are under development. The main dose-limiting side effect of cancer treatment with platinum compounds is&#160;neurotoxicity. These platinum complexes react in the body, binding to&#160;DNA&#160;and causing the DNA strands to&#160;crosslink, which ultimately triggers cells to&#160;die in a programmed way (apopoptosis). </p>

The chelating agent may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally, depending on the agent and the type of poisoning. Tiols contains proteins it's a group of organic chemicals, these include, for example, cysteine, coenzyme A . Tiols contains proteins bind very strongly mercury compounds. With metal ions, thiolates behave as ligands to form transition metal thiolate complexes. it has tendency of thiols to bind to soft elements Orions dry as mercury, lead, or cadmium.</p>

            <p>Atomic carbon is stabilized in various multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called allotropes. The relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are amorphous carbon, graphite, and diamond. Next is, fullerenes which are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanobuds and nanofibers.<br>
                Diamond, having nearly twice the density of graphite. Diamond has the same cubic structure as silicon and germanium, and because of the strength of the carbon-carbon bonds, it is the hardest naturally occurring substance measured by resistance to scratching.<br>
                Nanodiamonds are diamonds with a size below 1 micrometre. <br>
                A single imperfection can give a nanodiamond an isolated color center, which lets it function as single, trapped atom. Relative to the defect size, they have huge surface areas that allow them to bond with <br>
                a variety of other materials. Their non-toxicity means that nanodiamonds may be useful in biomedical and mechanical applications.<br>
                Nanodiamonds with attached molecules are able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier that isolates the brain from most insults. In 2013 doxorubicin molecules (a popular cancer-killing drug) were bonded to nanodiamond surfaces, creating the drug ND-DOX. Tests showed that tumors were unable to eject the compound, increasing the drug's ability to impact the tumor and reducing side-effects.<br>
                Nanodiamonds are well-absorbed by human skin. They also absorb more of the ingredients in skin care products than skin itself. Thus they cause more of the ingredients to penetrate the deeper layers <br>

                Examples include: Buckyball clusters: Nanotubes; Megatubes; Polymers like &quot;nano&quot;onions; fullerene rings.<br>
                Carbon nanotubes are cylindrical carbon molecules have unusual properties, which are valuable for nanotechnology, electronics, optics and other fields of materials science and technology. Owing to the material's exceptional strength and stiffness, nanotubes have been constructed with length-to-diameter ratio of up significantly larger than for any other material.<br>
                In addition, owing to their extraordinary thermal conductivity, mechanical, and electrical properties, carbon nanotubes find applications as additives to various structural materials. <br>
                Carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus respectively. <br>
                The toxicity of carbon nanotubes has been an important question, available data clearly show that, under some conditions, nanotubes can cross membrane barriers, which suggests that, if raw materials reach the organs, they can induce harmful effects such as inflammatory and fibrotic reactions<br>

It helps to minimiye adverse effects. Nanorobots are used to kill cancer cells in our body. They have special sensors which help them in finding ill cells in our body. Nanorobots can be used to remove clot from our blood vessels. Unfortunetly nanorobots still develop and they aren't commonly in hospitals. Nanomachine is introduced into our body and allow access to operation. Often doctors gain acces via circulatory system. Later they move nanomachine by propeller vibrating silia electromagnetic pump jet pump or let it flow with blood. They control location of this nanorobot by ultrasonic, NMR/MRI, radioactive dye, X-ray. Next step it to remove or inject drug into ill cells, and thats all. For example in arteriosclerosis nanorobots have blade and phisically separate deposits of plaque from artery walls. We can treat kidney or liver stones and gout too. I think nanorobots will develop in close time and they will help to treat a lot of diseases. </p>

                SOLUTIONS are multicomponent systems. Each solution consists of a solvent or dispersion medium, and at least one solute that is the dispersed phase.<br>

            <p>Raoult&rsquo;s law a law stating that the freezing and boiling points of an ideal solution are respectively depressed and elevated relative to that of the pure solvent by an amount proportional to the mole fraction of solute.<br>
                Colligative properties of solutions are properties that depend upon the concentration of solute molecules or ions, but not upon the identity of the solute. Colligative properties include freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, vapor pressure lowering, and osmotic pressure.<br>
                Freezing-point depression describes the process in which adding a solute to a solvent decreases the freezing point of the solvent. Examples include salt in water, alcohol in water, or the mixing of two solids such as impurities in a finely powdered drug.<br>
                Boiling point elevation is the phenomenon that occurs when the boiling point of a liquid (a solvent) is increased when another compound is added, such that the solution has a higher boiling point than the pure solvent. Boiling point elevation occurs whenever a non-volatile solute is added to a pure solvent.</p>

                Dalton's law In a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total pressure exerted is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases. This law has its most immediate medical implications in the calculation of the alveolar gas, where partial pressures of atmospheric gases, water vapour and alveolar CO2 are used to calculate the partial pressure of alveolar oxygen. <br>
                Gases can and will be absorbed by blood and tissue. The quantity of gas that can be absorbed is determined by the gas's solubility and the Bunsen solubility coefficient is a measure of how much gas is absorbed (usually in milliliters of gas per milliliter of liquid) when the gas is at 1 atmosphere of pressure.</p>

            <p>Electrolytes are chemicals that break into ions (ionize) when they are dissolved in water. The positively-charged ions are called cations, while the negatively charged ions are called anions. Substances can be categorized as strong, weak and nonelectrolytes. <br>
                The substances, in aqueous which ionize almost completely into ions are known as strong electrolytes. The unionized molecules are present to such a small extent that it is not of any significance to study the ionization constant of strong electrolytes. For example: HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, NaOH, KOH, NaCl etc. are strong electrolytes. The substances, in aqueous which ionize to a small extent into ions are known as weak electrolytes. For example: CH3COOH, NH4 OH, HCN etc. are weak electrolytes. Nonelectrolytes, if a substance doesn&rsquo;t ionize in water at all, it&rsquo;s a nonelectrolyte. Examples: most carbon compounds are nonelectrolytes. Fats, sugars, and alcohols are largely nonelectrolytes.<br>
                Ostwald's dilution law<br>
                The law of mass-action applies to the ionisation of weak electrolytes , but not to strong electrolytes, when the concentrations must be replaced by the activities. Ostwald&rsquo;s dilution law is a relationship between the dissociation constant Kd and the degree of dissociation &#945; of a weak electrolyte. The law takes the form:</p>

            <p>
                The properties of the strong electrolytes solution. When the concentration of a solute <br>
                is greater than about 0.1 mol/dm3, or we have strong electrolytes solution (NaCl, HCl, etc.), interactions between the solute molecules or ions are significant, and the effective and real concentrations are no longer equal. It becomes necessary to define a new quantity called the activity, which is a measure of concentration but takes into account the interactions between the solution species.<br>
                Electrolytes are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are in your blood, urine and body fluids. Maintaining the right balance of electrolytes helps your body's blood chemistry, muscle action and other processes. Sodium, calcium, potassium, chlorine, phosphate and magnesium are all electrolytes. You get them from the foods you eat and the fluids you drink. Water balance is achieved in the body by ensuring that the amount of water consumed in food and drink (and generated by metabolism) equals the amount of water excreted. The consumption side is regulated by behavioral mechanisms, including thirst and salt cravings. While almost a liter of water per day is lost through the skin, lungs, and feces, the kidneys are the major site of regulated excretion of water.</p>

            <p>Electrical conductivity of chemically pure water is very insignificant. The degree of water dissociation, calculated by measurement of electric conductivity of water, is equal to 1.8.10-9. The number of water molecules which dissociate forming ions is extremely small. The process of water electrolytic dissociation is possible as a result of high polarity of the bond O&mdash;H and the presence of hydrogen bonds between molecules of water. In water and aqueous solutions hydrogen ions H+ interact with water molecules producing hydrated protons, these are oxonium ions H3O+:<br>
                H+ + H2O &harr; H3O+<br>
                So, the process of water dissociation may be presented as:<br>
                2H2O &harr; H3O+ + OH.<br>
                It is convenient to write down the equation of water dissociation in a simplified way:<br>
                H2O &harr; H+ + OH.<br>
                By applying the law of mass action to the reversible process of water dissociation it is possible to write down the next mathematical formula for the dissociation constant of water:<br>
                KdH2O = [H+] . [OH-] / [H2O] ,<br>
                where KdH2O is the water dissociation constant, which is equal to 1.86 . 10-16mol/l at room temperature; [H+] is the equilibrium molar concentration of H+ ions; [OH-] is the equilibrium molar concentration of OH- ions; [H2O] is the equilibrium molar concentration of undissociated water molecules.<br>
                The product of the equilibrium molar concentrations of H+ and OH- ions is a constant value and is called the ionic product of water K(H2O).<br>
                K(H2O) = [H+] .[OH-] = 10-14 mol2/l2 (t=25&deg;C).<br>
                Acid - Base indicators (also known as pH indicators) are substances which change colour with pH. They are usually weak acids or bases, which when dissolved in water dissociate slightly and form ions.<br>
                Strong Electrolytes<br>
                Strong electrolytes&#160;include the&#160;strong acids,&#160;strong bases, and salts. These chemical completely dissociate into ions in aqueous solution.<br>

            <p><b>28. Hydrolysis of salts, the degree of hydrolysis, its dependence from the concentration and the temperature, the hydrolysis constant. The role of hydrolysis in biochemical processes.</b></p>

            <p>Hydrolysis of salts is an interaction of salt ions with water leading to formation of slightly dissociated compounds, shifting the equilibrium of water dissociation and, as a rule, changing pH of the solution. In general case hydrolysis may be considered a reaction of substance decomposition by water (from the words hydro-water and lysis-decomposition). <br>
                Hydrolysis is a particular case of solvolysis that is interaction of a solute with a solvent.<br>
                Chemical compounds of different types can be subjected to hydrolysis: proteins, fats, carbohydrates, esters, salts, etc. In inorganic chemistry hydrolysis of salts occurs more often. <br>
                From the point of view of the Bronsted-Lowry theory, hydrolysis represents a particular case of reversible acid-base equilibrium. The mechanism of salt hydrolysis consists in interaction of salt ions (Lewis acid) with molecules of water (Lewis base) from the cluster of water molecules surrounding it. The stronger this interaction, the more intensive hydrolysis process.<br>
                Hydrolysis process consists in transition of protons:<br>
                a)from a water molecule to a salt anion, for example:<br>
                CO32- + HOH &harr;HCO3- + OH-;<br>
                b)from a cation to a water molecule, for example:<br>
                NH4+ + HOH &harr; NH3 + H3O+;<br>
                Four groups of salts may be distinguished:<br>
                &#61623;salts of strong acids and weak bases, for example, ammonium chloride;<br>
                &#61623;salts of strong bases and weak acids, for example, sodium nitrite;<br>
                &#61623;salts of weak acids and weak bases, for example, ammonium acetate;<br>
                &#61623;salts of strong acids and strong bases, for example, sodium chloride.<br>
                Hydrolysis is possible only for salts having cations of weak bases or anions of weak acids in their structure, exactly the salts of the first three groups.<br>
                Salts formed by a strong acid and strong base (NaCl, KNO, etc.) do not hydrolyze as ions of such salts do not form slightly dissociated compounds with water ions. In this case dissociation water equilibrium in the presence of salt does not shift, and solutions are practically neutral (pH=7). Salts of weak polybasic acids or multiacid bases hydrolyze step-wise, forming acidic or basic salts.<br>
                Quantitatively hydrolysis, as well as acid-base equilibrium, is characterized by the degree of hydrolysis &#945;h and the hydrolysis constant Kh.<br>
                The degree of salt hydrolysis is the ratio between the number of hydrolyzed molecules and the total number of molecules in a solution, or the ratio between the hydrolyzed salt concentration and the total salt concentration:<br>
                &#945;h= n(hydr.) / n(total), or &#945;h= c(hydr.) / c(total).<br>
                The degree of hydrolysis is expressed in fractions of unit or in percents. In solutions of the moderate concentration at room temperature, the degree of hydrolysis of the majority of salts is small. So, for 0.1 molar Na2CO3 solution at 298 K &#945;h= 2.7 %, and for 0.1 molar NaCN solution &#945;h= 1.5%.<br>
                The degree of hydrolysis depends on the nature of salts, their concentration and temperature. According to the mass action law, the degree of hydrolysis increases at dilution of solution. The qualitative influence of temperature on the degree of hydrolysis can be prognosticated based on Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle. As the hydrolysis process in an endothermic process, according to Le Chatelier&rsquo;s principle, with rising of temperature the hydrolysis degree also increases.<br>
                Hydrolysis is related to energy metabolism and storage. All living cells require a continual supply of energy for two main purposes: the biosynthesis of micro and macromolecules, and the active transport of ions and molecules across cell membranes. The energy derived from the oxidation of nutrients is not used directly but, by means of a complex and long sequence of reactions, it is channelled into a special energy-storage molecule, adenosine triphosphate (ATP).<br>
                In addition, in living systems, most biochemical reactions (including ATP hydrolysis) take place during the catalysis of enzymes. The catalytic action of enzymes allows the hydrolysis of proteins, fats, oils, and carbohydrates.</p>

                Acid - Base indicators (also known as pH indicators) are substances which change colour with pH. They are usually weak acids or bases, which when dissolved in water dissociate slightly and form ions. Most commonly used indicators in acid-base titration: methyl orange, methyl red, litmus, phenolophtalein.</p>

            <p>Buffer capacity is a measure of the efficiency of a buffer in resisting changes in pH. Conventionally, the buffer capacity is expressed as the amount of strong acid or base, in gram-equivalents, that must be added to 1 liter of the solution to change its pH by one unit. In practice, smaller pH changes are measured and the buffer capacity is quantitatively expressed as the ratio of acid or base added to the change in pH produced. The buffer capacity depends essentially on 2 factors : 1.Ratio of the salt to the acid or base &ndash; the buffer capacity is optimal when the ratio is 1 : 1, that is, when pH = pKa 2.Total buffer concentration &ndash; it will take more acid or base to deplete a 0,5 M buffer than a 0,05 M buffer.<br>
                Carbon Dioxide <br>
                Carbon dioxide (CO2) combines with water forming carbonic acid, which dissociates into a hydrogen ion (H+) and a bicarbonate ions: <br>
                CO2+ H2O H2CO3H++ HCO3 <br>
                Bicarbonate buffer, one of the more important buffers in blood, has three components. Recall that buffering capacity is greatest at or near the &#618;&#1050;a of the acid-conjugate base pair. Bicarbonate buffer is clearly unusual in that its &#618;&#1050;a is 6.1. It would appear at first glance that bicarbonate buffer is ill-suited to fulfill its role as an important buffering system of blood. The ratio of HCO3-to CO2 required to maintain pH of 7.4 is approximately 20 to 1. In other words, the bicarbonate buffer operates in blood near the limit of its buffering power. <br>
                Phosphate Buffer. <br>
                Phosphate buffer consists of the weak acid-conjugate base pair H2PO4 ( -) and HPO4 (-2) , Although the blood pH of 7.4 is well within this buffer system&rsquo;s capability, the concentrations of H2PO4-and HPO42-in blood are too low to have &#1072; major effect. Instead, the phosphate system is an important buffer in intracellular fluids. <br>
                Protein Buffer. <br>
                Proteins are significant source of buffering capacity. Composed of amino acids linked together bypeptide bonds, proteins contain ionizable groups that candonate or accept protons. Several of these groups have &#618;&#1050;a values that are close to 7.4. For example, the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin is the most abundant biomolecule in red blood cells<br>
                The most important buffer for maintaining acid-base balance in the blood is the carbonic-cid-bicarbonate buffer. The organs which act important role in buffer systems in human organism: -lungs remove the CO2 -kidneys remove HCO3- -high heart rate hinders CO2 removal the pH of the buffered solution (i.e., the blood) is dependent only ontheratio of the amount of CO2 present in the blood to the amount of HCO3-(bicarbonate ion) present in the blood (at a given temperature, so that pK remains constant). This ratio remains relatively constant, because the concentrations of both buffer components (HCO3- and CO2) are very large, compared to the amount of H+added to the blood during normal activities and moderate exercise. When H+ is added to the blood as a result of metabolic processes, the amount of HCO3- (relative to theamount of CO2) decreases; however, the amount of the change is tiny compared to the amount of HCO3- present in the blood.</p>

            <p><b>32. Acidosis and alkalosis. The reasons of formation, the ways of detection and correction.</b></p>

            <p>Acidosis is an increased acidity in the blood and other body tissue. If not further qualified, it usually refers to acidity of the blood plasma. Acidosis is said to occur when arterial pH falls below 7.35 <br>
                Alkalosis is the result of a process reducing hydrogen ion concentration of arterial blood plasma (alkalemia). In contrast to acidemia (serum pH 7.35 or lower), alkalemia occurs when the serum pH is higher than normal (7.45 or higher).<br>
                To detect an acid-base disturbance, both a&#160;blood gas analysis&#160;and&#160;chemistry panel&#160;should be performed. This combines traditional blood gas analysis (Henderson-Hasselback equation) and the strong ion approach (by evaluating the contributions of electrolytes, in particular). The blood gas analysis and chemistry panel&#160;provide information on most of the variables responsible for acid-base disturbances and the results should be used together for&#160;interpretation. Note also that other information should be used to determine the cause for acid-base disturbances, including clinical signs and examination findings (e.g. diarrhea may cause a metabolic acidosis), the&#160;hemogram&#160;(e.g. hypoxia from an anemia may cause a respiratory alkalosis), and diagnostic imaging (pulmonary disease may cause respiratory acid-base abnormalities). This section also provides more detailed information on individual test results, specifically&#160;anion gap&#160;and&#160;bicarbonate. Information on&#160;sodium&#160;and&#160;chloride&#160;(strong ions) are given under the&#160;electrolyte&#160;section of the site.<br>
                The ideal treatment for metabolic acidosis is correction of the underlying cause. When urgency dictates more rapid correction, treatment is based on clinical considerations, supported by laboratory evidence. The best measure of the level of metabolic acidosis is the Standard Base Excess (SBE) because it is independent of PCO2. If it is decided to administer bicarbonate, the SBE and the size of the treatable space are used to calculate the dose required.&#160;<br>
                Treating Severe Metabolic Alkalosis<br>
                Physiological Response:&#160;Adequate hydration normally allows the kidneys to correct the problem. However, in severe cases accompanied by hypokalemia, correction of the hypokalemia may be necessary first.<br>
                As with metabolic acidosis, ideal treatment is the correction of the underlying abnormality. More active intervention is occasionally required and various techniques are available. A common transient cause is iatrogenic; correction of acute metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate leaves a residual metabolic alkalosis. Time, hydration, and renal function should gradually correct this.<br>
                Contraction alkalosis&#160;is one of the easier causes to understand and treat. Dehydration concentrates the body's electrolytes. As the extracellular fluid (pH = 7.4) is on the alkaline side of neutral (pH = 6.8), the relative alkaline mixture of electrolytes is concentrated and shifts the pH to more alkaline value. Rehydration, e.g., with oral fluids or intravenous Ringer's lactate, restores the normal electrolyte concentration and, therefore, the pH.<br>
                Other therapies:&#160;Intravenous dilute hydrochloric acid is occasionally used but carries the risk of hemolysis. Potassium chloride may also be used unless there is kidney failure. In severe cases which are unresponsive to other measures ammonium chloride may be given (1 to 2 g orally every 4 to 6 hours up to 4 g every 2 hours. It may also given by intravenous infusion (100 to 200 mEq dissolved in 500 to 1000 ml of isotonic saline) in addition to potassium replacement. In severe unresponsive metabolic alkalosis it may be necessary to administer hydrochloric acid or institute peritoneal dialysis.<br>
                Specific therapy depends on the underlying pathology. For details visit:&#160;E-Medicine (Christie Thomas).<br>
                Emergency Therapy.<br>
                The body's metabolism produces respiratory (carbonic) acid and, in ischemia or cardiorespiratory failure, metabolic (lactic) acid. In emergencies, therefore, urgent correction is most commonly required for metabolic or respiratory acidosis.</p>

            <p>Calculating the Bicarbonate Dose.<br>
                The diagram shows an example of a patient with a (pure) metabolic acidosis, SBE = -18 mEq/L. To achieve complete correction for someone weighing 70 kg:<br>
                Dose (mEq)&#160;=&#160;0.3&#160; x&#160;Wt (kg)&#160;x&#160;SBE (mEq/L)<br>
                378 &#160; &#160; &#160; =&#160;0.3 &#160;x &#160; &#160; 70 &#160; &#160; x &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; &#160;<br>
                This assumes that the treatable compartment is about 30% of the body, i.e., about 21 liters. Our intention , of course, is to normalize the&#160;&quot;Bath Water&quot;, &#160;&#160;i.e., the extracellular fluid, which is 20% of the body (about 14 liters). But, because the injected bicarbonate also equilibrates to some extent with the intracellular fluid, the &quot;treatable volume&quot; is larger.</p>

            <p>Osmosis - one-sided diffusion of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane to more concentrated solution. <br>
                Semipermeable membrane in biological systems there may be membranes permeable only for solvent molecules. In this case the solute molecules can&rsquo;t diffuse through a membrane, but solvent molecules can move in both directions, besides, the number of solvent molecules that got into a more concentrated solution is greater than the number of solvent molecules that pass into the opposite direction, where there is a more diluted solution. <br>
                Osmotic pressure is the external pressure on a solution, at which osmotic equilibrium (through a semipermeable membrane) between the solution and a pure solvent is established. <br>
                For diluted solutions of non-eleclorytes Van&rsquo;t Hoff proposed the next law: Osmotic pressure of a solution is equal to the pressure that a solute would have it if were in a gaseous state at a given temperature and occupied the same volume that the solution occupies. <br>
                The mathematical expression of this law is: <br>
                &#960; = c(X)&bull;R&bull;T <br>
                where &#960; is osmotic pressure, c(X) is molarity of the solute X, R is the universal gas constant, T is temperature. <br>
                Van&rsquo;t Hoff&rsquo;s law for diluted solutions of non-eleclorytes has another formulation: Osmotic pressure of diluted solutions of non-eleclorytes is directly proportional to solution molarity, its absolute temperature and does not depend on the nature of the solute. <br>
                Isotonic - solutions with an identical value of osmotic pressure. <br>
                Hypertonic - solutions with a higher osmotic pressure than that of a standard solution of comparison. Hypotonic - solutions with a lower osmotic pressure than that of a standard solution of comparison. Plasmolysis is the process in which cells lose water in a hypertonic solution. The reverse process, cytolysis, can occur if the cell is in a hypotonic solution resulting in a lower external osmotic pressure and a net flow of water into the cell. <br>
                Hemolysis is the breakdown of red blood cells. The ability of bacterial colonies to induce hemolysis when grown on blood agar is used to classify certain microorganisms. A substance that causes hemolysis is a hemolysin. <br>
                Turgor pressure pushes the plasma membrane against the cell wall of plant, bacterial, and fungal cells as well as those protist cells which have cell walls. This pressure, turgidity or turgidness, is caused by the osmotic flow of water from an area of low solute concentration outside the cell into the cell's vacuole, which has a higher solute concentration. </p>

            <p><b>34. The first law of thermodynamics. The internal energy. Enthalpy. The heat of isobaric and isochoric processes.</b></p>

            <p>The first law of thermodynamics: Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but only can be converted from one form into another (including heat and work), without changing quantitatively. The first law is often formulated by stating that the change in the internal energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of heat supplied to the system, minus the amount of work done by the system on its surroundings. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible. <br>
                &#916;U = Q - W <br>
                The change in internal energy (&#916;U) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W). <br>
                Internal energy of a system is the energy contained within the system, excluding the kinetic energy of motion of the system as a whole and the potential energy of the system as a whole due to external force fields. It keeps account of the gains and losses of energy of the system that are due to changes in its internal state. The internal energy of a system can be changed by transfers of matter or heat or by doing work. <br>
                Enthalpy is a measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system. It is the thermodynamic quantity equivalent to the total heat content of a system. It is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume. More technically, it includes the internal energy, which is the energy required to create a system, and the amount of energy required to make room for it by displacing its environment and establishing its volume and pressure. <br>
                H = U + pV <br>
                H is the enthalpy of the system, U is the internal energy of the system, p is the pressure of the system, V is the volume of the system. <br>
                An isobaric process is a thermodynamic process in which the pressure stays constant: &#916;P = 0. The heat transferred to the system does work, but also changes the internal energy of the system. This article uses the chemistry sign convention for work, where positive work is work done on the system. An isochoric process, also called a constant-volume process, is a thermodynamic process during which the volume of the closed system undergoing such a process remains constant. An isochoric process is exemplified by the heating or the cooling of the contents of a sealed, inelastic container. The thermodynamic process is the addition or removal of heat, the isolation of the contents of the container establishes the closed system, and the inability of the container to deform imposes the constant-volume condition. The isochoric process here should be a quasi-static process. </p>

                Standard heat of formation is the change of enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of the compound from its constituent elements with all substances in their standard states. <br>
                Standard heat of combuston is the total energy released as heat when a substance undergoescomplete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions. </p>

                Electrode potential appears at the interface between an electrode and electrolyte due to the transfer of charged species across the interface, specific adsorption of ions at the interface, and specific adsorption/orientation of polar molecules, including those of the solvent. Electrode potential is the electric potential on an electrode component. In a cell, there will be an electrode potential for the cathode, and an electrode potential for the anode. The difference between the two electrode potentials equals the cell potential.<br>

            <p>One of the most common real life examples of a redox reaction is one that is necessary for life itself, in which a cell oxidizes glucose to carbon dioxide and reduces oxygen to water, providing energy through cellular respiration. In plants, the reaction occurs in the opposite direction and uses energy supplied by the sun. <br>
                Many important biological processes involve redox reaction:<br>
                Cellular respiration, for example, is the oxidation of glucose (C6H12O6) to CO2 and the reduction of oxygen to water. <br>
                The summary equation for cell respiration is:<br>
                C6H12O6 + 6 O2 &rarr; 6 CO2 + 6 H2O<br>
                The process of cell respiration also depends heavily on the reduction of NAD+ to NADH and the reverse reaction (the oxidation of NADH to NAD+). Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary, but photosynthesis is not the reverse of the redox reaction in cell respiration:<br>
                6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy &rarr; C6H12O6 + 6 O2<br>
                Biological energy is frequently stored and released by means of redox reactions. Photosynthesis involves the reduction of carbon dioxide into sugars and the oxidation of water into molecular oxygen. The reverse reaction, respiration, oxidizes sugars to produce carbon dioxide and water. As intermediate steps, the reduced carbon compounds are used to reduce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), which then contributes to the creation of a proton gradient, which drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is maintained by the reduction of oxygen. </p>

            <p>The rate of chemical reaction or speed of reaction for a reactant or product in a particular reaction is intuitively defined as how quickly or slowly a reaction takes place. For example, the oxidative rusting of iron under Earth's atmosphere is a slow reaction that can take many years, but the combustion of cellulose in a fire is a reaction that takes place in fractions of a second. The rate of a chemical reaction is the change in concentration over the change in time. <br>
                The rate law (Guldberg law of mass action): &lsquo;At constant temperature the rate of chemical reaction is in proportion to the product of reactant concentrations&rsquo; This law is just for simple (single-stage) reactions. If reactions are complex and may be considered as a totality of consecutive single-stage processes, the law may be applied only to these processes individually. For homogeneous reaction aA+bB &rarr;cAB v = k [A]n &#8729; [B]m <br>

            <p><b>45. The Arrhenius equation. The activation energy. Collision and transition-state theories.</b> </p>

            <p>The Arrhenius equation: is a formula for the temperature dependence of reaction rates. The equation was proposed by Svante Arrhenius based on the Van&rsquo;t Hoffs equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions. This equation has a vast and important application in determining rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation. <br>
                Collision theory: In this theory, molecules are supposed to react if they collide with a relative kinetic energy along their lines-of-center that exceeds Ea. This leads to an expression very similar to the Arrhenius equation. <br>
                Transition state theory: k=kTe/h^-&#916;G^4/RT free energy is itself a temperature dependent quantity. The free energy of activation is the difference of an enthalpy term and an entropy term multiplied by the absolute temperature. <br>
                Activation energy: for reactants to transform into products, they must first acquire a minimum amount of energy, called the activation energy. </p>

            <p>Homogeneous catalysis are catalytic reactions where the catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants, so homogeneous catalysis applies to reactions in the gas phase and even in a solid. <br>
                Heterogenous catalysis is the alternative to homogeneous catalysis, where the catalysis occurs at the interface of two phases, typically gas-solid. <br>
                The mechanism of catalyst reaction depends on fact that catalyst decreases activation energy, what allows the reaction exist without using high temperature. The best example are metabolic processes in our organism. They need a lot of proteins to exist. Metabolic reactions would need really high temperature to work good, but proteins in temperature higher than 40 celsius degrees denature.<br>
                To solve this problem our organism has enzymes - biocatalysts which decrease activation energy of metabolic reactions, so they can work without high temperature.</p>

            <p><b>47. Enzymes as catalysts of biochemical reactions. The dependence of the enzymatic action on enzyme and substrate concentrations, temperature and pH.</b></p>

            <p>The majority of biochemical processes are catalytic processes, in which specific substances called enzymes take part as catalysts. Enzymes differ from other types of catalysts because they are highly selective and efficient. Thus it is known that extremely small quantities of enzymes can increase the reaction rate by thousand or million times as compared with uncatalyzed reactions. It should noted that the activity of biocatalysts depends on temperature - the optimum temperature is about 37&#8304;C. Above this temperature the enzyme structure begins to break down (denature) since at higher temperatures intra- and intermolecular bonds are broken. The activity also depends on pH. Each enzyme works within quite a small pH range. There is a pH at which its activity is greatest (the optimal pH). This is because changes in pH can make and break intra- and intermolecular bonds, changing the shape of the enzyme and, therefore, its effectiveness. The rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction depends on the concentrations of enzyme and substrate. As the concentration of either is increased the rate of reaction increases. For a given enzyme concentration, the rate of reaction increases with increasing substrate concentration up to a point, above which any further increase in substrate concentration produces no significant change in reaction rate. This is because the active sites of the enzyme molecules at any given moment are virtually saturated with substrate.</p>

            <p>Michaelis-Menten equation&#160;is one of the best-known models of&#160;enzyme kinetics. An equation describing the rate of enzymatic reactions, by relating reactions rate v to S.<br>
                v= d[P]/dt = Vmax[S]/KM+[S]<br>
                Vmax&#160;represents the maximum rate achieved by the system, at saturating substrate concentration. The Michaelis constant&#160;KM is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of Vmax.<br>
                The model serves to explain how an enzyme can cause kinetic rate enhancement of a reaction and explains how reaction rates depends on the concentration of enzyme and substrate.<br>
                Linear plots of the Michaelis&ndash;Menten equation:<br>
                linearisations of the Michaelis&ndash;Menten equation, such as the&#160;Lineweaver&ndash;Burk plot, the&#160;Eadie&ndash;Hofstee diagram&#160;and the&#160;Hanes&ndash;Woolf plot. All of these linear representations can be useful for visualising data, but none should be used to determine kinetic parameters.<br>
                1)The&#160;Lineweaver&ndash;Burk plot&#160;(double reciprocal plot) is a common way of illustrating kinetic data. This is produced by taking the&#160;reciprocal&#160;of both sides of the Michaelis&ndash;Menten equation. This is a linear form of the Michaelis&ndash;Menten equation.</p>

            <p>1/v = KM/Vmax[S] + 1/Vmax</p>

            <p>A new method is presented for the determination of kinetic parameters based on a functional relationship among experimental data derived from the postulated model. The data, even though containing errors, are manifestations of this relationship, which should be satisfied by parameters fitted to the system. The procedure involves the use of numerical integration and/or differentiation of the data, followed by multiple linear regression. It does not require initial estimates or repetitive iteration for linear systems and can be applied to nonlinear models. The accuracy of estimated parameter depends on the goodness of the particular numerical approximation method used.</p>

            <p>Enzymes play central roles in life processes. It holds for most enzymes that their function is needed only in certain conditions. When those conditions do not apply, the activity of a given enzyme can be futile or even harmful. Accordingly, the activity of most enzymes is under strict control.<br>
                Competitive, Uncompetitive, and Noncompetitive inhibitors<br>
                Competitive inhibitors, uncompetitive inhibitors, and noncompetitive inhibitors are all types of reversible enzyme inhibition. Inhibitors can prevent a substrate from binding, decrease the enzyme's catalytic activity, or do both. Many drugs are enzyme inhibitors.<br>
                Competitive inhibitors<br>
                Competitive inhibitors work by binding at the active site on the enzyme. They compete with substrate for the active site and prevent the substrate from binding. Their structure is similar to that of the substrate since they are binding at the same site. The presence of these inhibitors causes an increase in Km of the enzyme, but leaves Vmax unaffected.<br>
                Noncompetitive inhibitors<br>
                Pure noncompetitive inhibitors are similar to uncompetitive inhibitors. Like uncompetitive inhibitors, they have a separate binding site on the enzyme and can bind the enzyme-substrate complex. However, they can also bind the enzyme when substrate is not bound. Presence of a noncompetitive inhibitor will decrease Vmax and will not affect Km.<br>
                Uncompetitive inhibitors<br>
                Uncompetitive inhibitors differ from competitive inhibitors in that they have a separate binding site on the enzyme. Also, they only bind to the enzyme when substrate is bound to the enzyme. Uncompetitive inhibitors decrease both Vmax and Km.<br>
                Inhibition of an enzyme <br>
                By its substrate occurs whenever a dead-end enzyme-substrate complex forms. Such a reaction usually occurs at high substrate concentrations and is due to that substrate binding to a form of enzyme with which the product of the substrate normally combines.<br>
                Example:<br>
                Contact inhibition is a regulatory mechanism that functions to keep cells growing into a layer one cell thick (a monolayer). If a cell has plenty of available substrate space, it replicates rapidly and moves freely. This process continues until the cells occupy the entire substratum. At this point, normal cells will stop replicating. </p>

            <p>Chemical equilibrium is the state in which both reactants and products are present in concentrations which have no further tendency to change with time. Usually, this state results when the forward reaction proceeds at the same rate as the reverse reaction. What about thermodynami condition of equilibrium? It is an internal state of a single thermodynamic system, or a relation between several thermodynamic systems connected by more or less permeable or impermeable walls. In thermodynamic equilibrium there are no net macroscopic flows of matter or of energy, either within a system or between systems. When we are talking about prediction of spontaneoous processes, we must know a spontaneous process is the time-evolution of a system in which it releases free energy and moves to a lower, more thermodynamically stable energy state.<br>
                Reactions with negative enthalpies indicate heat release; the products are lower in energy than the reactants and the reactionwith positive enthalpies indicate that heat must be input into thesystem for the reaction to proceed. The products are higher in energy than the reactants and the reaction will not usually proceed spontaneously. An example of an exergonic reaction that occurs in our body is cellular respiration.An example of an endergonic reaction in the cell is the formation of a peptide bond.A homogeneous equilibrium&#160;is one in which all of the reactants and products are present in a single solution (by definition, a homogeneous mixture). Reactions between solutes in liquid solutions belong to one type of homogeneous equilibria. The chemical species involved can be molecules, ions, or a mixture of both.A heterogeneous equilibrium&#160;is a system in which reactants and products are found in two or more phases. The phases may be any combination of solid, liquid, or gas phases, and solutions. When dealing with these equilibria, remember that solids and pure liquids do not appear in equilibrium constant expressions.</p>

            <p>Chemical equilibrium is the thermodynamic equilibrium in a system where direct and reverse chemical reactions are possible.

Therefore, the macroscopic parameters of the system do not change and the relationship between concentrations of reacting substances remains constant at a given temperature. <br>
                Le Chatelier-Braun principle (1885-1886). It consists of the following correlation: Let equilibrium take place and then influence the system, changing some external conditions (temperature, pressure, concentrations of reacting substances). The equilibrium of a reaction tends to follow such direction that allows the reduction of an external influence.</p>

            <p>Diffusion potential is the potential difference generated across a membrane because <br>
                of a concentration difference of an ion. It can be generated only if the membranes is permeable to the ion. The size of the diffusion potential depends on the size of the concentration gradient. The sign <br>
                of diffusion potential depends on whether the diffusing ion is positively or negatively charged. Diffusion potentials are created by the diffusion of very few ions which do not result in changes in concentration of the diffusing ions.<br>
                Equilibrium potential is the diffusion potential that exactly balances (opposes) the tendency for diffusion caused by a concentration difference. At electrochemical equilibrium, the chemical and electrical driving forces that act on an ion are equal and opposite; therefore, no net diffusion of the ions occur.</p>

                Gibbs Free Energy (G) - The energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work. The free energy of a system is the sum of its enthalpy (H) plus the product of the temperature (Kelvin) and the entropy (S) of the system: The role of the orientation of a molecule in its interaction with a surface is examined for a number of cases. At first the determination of the static orientation of a molecule at the surface is discussed. Dissociative chemisorption of hydrogen molecules is found to depend on the initial orientation of the molecule. Finally, in dissociative collisions of fast molecules with surfaces the role of the initial orientation is examined and the final orientation of the molecular axis is determined. <br>
                Surface active substances, also known as surfactants, are those substances which preferentially adsorb at the air-liquid, liquid-liquid or liquid-solid interfaces. The surface activity of a solute refers to a particular solvent. Molecules of surface active substances contain at least two distinct parts, a moiety which interacts strongly with the solvent, the lyophilic part, and another moiety the lyophobic part, whose interaction with the solvent is less than its interaction with molecules of a structure similar to its own. A biological membrane or biomembrane is an enclosing or separating membrane that acts as a selectively permeable barrier within living things. Biological membranes, in the form of cell membranes, often consist of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded, integral and peripheral proteins used in communication and transportation of chemicals and ions. Bulk lipid in membrane provides a fluid matrix for proteins to rotate and laterally diffuse for physiological functioning. </p>

            <p>54. Adsorption from solutions on a solid surface. Langmuir and Freundlich<br>
                equation. Physico-chemical basis of adsorption therapy.<br>
                To understand the adsorption at the interface between a solid adsorbent and solution, one has to take into account, that here three substances are in contact at the same time - the adsorbent is in contact with both solvent and solute. Of course, adsorption of solute, and not of the solvent is required, because it allows to extract the solute from solution. As well, in some cases the adsorption of solute from solution provides a possibility to get rid of some admixtures, that are present in solution (for instance, to get rid of aldehydes and higher alcohols in the industry of alcoholic drinks), in other cases it allows to separate a necessary compound from solvent. <br>
                In order to carry out the adsorption of solute, one has to be sure, that the solvent is not adsorbed - as soon as the solvent can be adsorbed on the given adsorbent, it will immediately cover all the adsorbent&rsquo;s surface (as there is great am mount of solvent) and no place will remain for the solute. Practically all this means, that if the solute is a polar compound, a polar (hydrophilic) adsorbent has to be chosen (polar compounds are adsorbed well on polar surfaces), but the solvent must be a non-polar compound. In the contrary case, if the solute, that has to be adsorbed, is non-polar, a non-polar (hydrophobic) adsorbent has to be used, but the solvent has to be polar (then it will not be adsorbed). If the solute, that has to be adsorbed, is a SAC, it can be adsorbed on both polar and non-polar adsorbents (remember, that molecules of SAC are biphile). In such a case just opposite characters of solvent and adsorbent have to be chosen. Let us discuss a real example. If acetic acid (it is a SAC) has to be adsorbed from its water solution, one has to choose a hydrophobic adsorbent, for instance. Then acetic acid will be adsorbed, but water not. If the same acetic acid has to be adsorbed from its benzene (a non-polar solvent) solution, the adsorbent has to be chosen hydrophilic (polar), for instance, it could be silica gel. Acetic acid as a SAC can be adsorbed on silica gel, but benzene cannot. <br>
                All-in-all, adsorption on solid adsorbents from solutions is affected by the following factors: <br>
                1) t&deg; - the higher is temperature, the lower is adsorption, <br>
                2) concentration of solute - the greater it is, the greater is adsorption, <br>
                3) nature of adsorbent and solvent (see discussion above), <br>
                4) nature of solute (see discussion above), <br>
                5) the relations between solute and solvent - the lower is solubility of the given solute in the given solvent, the greater will be adsorption. <br>
                The&#160;Freundlich equation&#160;or&#160;Freundlich adsorption isotherm, an&#160;adsorption isotherm, is an empirical relation between the&#160;concentration&#160;of a&#160;solute&#160;on the surface of an&#160;adsorbent&#160;to the concentration of the solute in the liquid with which it is in contact. </p>

            <p>Dialysis is the removal of soluble impurities from sols by the use of semipermeable membrane. The ordinary process of dialysis is slow. The apparatus used for this purpose is called Dialyser. Cellophane bag is filled with impure colloidal solution and placed in fresh water ( distilled water ). The cellophane bag is not allow the colloidal particles to pass through, but particles of true solution can pass through it. The molecules and ions diffuse through the membrane into the outer water and pure colloidal solution is left behind. The water is renewed frequently to avoid accumulation of the crystalloid as otherwise they may start diffusing back into the bag. <br>
                Electrodialysis is the removal of soluble impurities from sols by the use of semipermeable membrane in the presence of electric field. Cellophane bag is filled with impure colloidal solution and placed in fresh water ( distilled water ). The cellophane bag is not allow the colloidal particles to pass through, but particles of true solution can pass through it. Now the electric field is applied. The soluble particles passed through the membrane and migrate towards the oppositely charged electrodes. Leaving behind the pure colloidal solution. The most important application of dialysis process in purification of the artificial kidney mechaine, used for the purification of blood. <br>
                Ultra filtration in this method, colloidal solutions are purified by carrying out filtration through special type of filters called ultra-filters. Sols pass through ordinary filter paper, So that use special filter paper. The filters are permeable to all substances except the colloidal particles. This process is very slow. Pressure are suction is applied to speed it up. </p>

            <p>Brownian movement can be defined as continuous zig-zag movement of the colloidal particles in a colloidal solution. Due to Brownian motion the colloidal particles are capable to diffuse from the regions with higher concentration to the regions with lower concentration of the dispersed phase. The osmotic pressure has been used to determine the average molecular masses of colloidal particles.</p>

            <p><b>60. Optical properties of colloidal systems. Ultramikroskopiya.</b></p>

            <p>Optical properties of colloidal systems. When an intense converging beam of light is passed through a colloidal solution kept in dark, the path of the beam gets illuminated with a bluish light. This phenomenon is called Tyndall effect. Tyndall scattering can be seen even in dispersions that are transparent. As the density of particles or the particle size increases, the light scattering may become great enough to produce a &quot;cloudy&quot; effect, as like in a smoke-filled room This is the reason that milk, fog, and clouds themselves appear to be white. The individual water droplets in clouds (or the butterfat droplets in milk) are actually transparent, but the intense light scattering disperses the light in all directions, preventing us from seeing through them. <br>
                Ultramicroscope Colloidal particles are, like molecules, too small to be visible though an ordinary optical microscope. However, if one looks in a direction perpendicular to the light beam, a colloidal particle will &quot;appear&quot; over a dark background as a tiny speck due to the Tyndall scattering. <br>
                A microscope specially designed for this application is known as an ultramicroscope. <br>
                The ultramicroscope in does not really allow us to &quot;see&quot; the particle; the scattered light merely indicates where it is at any given instant. </p>

            <p>Gel Filtration (Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)- is a chromatographic method in which molecules in solution are separated by their size, and in some cases molecular weight. Its usually applied to large molecules or macromolecular complexes such as proteins and industrial polymers. In gel filtration chromatography, the stationary phase consists of porous beads with a well-defined range of pore sizes. Proteins that are small enough can fit inside all the pores in the beads and are said to be included. Proteins that are too large to fit inside any of the pores are said to be excluded. Proteins of intermediate size are partially included - meaning they can fit inside some but not all of the pores in the beads.<br>
                Ion exchange chromatography -involves the separation of ionizable molecules based on their total charge. It works on almost any kind of charged molecule&mdash;including large proteins, small nucleotides, and amino acids. It is often used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control. The water-soluble and charged molecules such as proteins, amino acids, and peptides bind to moieties which are oppositely charged by forming ionic bonds to the insoluble stationary phase. The equilibrated stationary phase consists of an ionizable functional group where the targeted molecules of a mixture to be separated and quantified can bind while passing through the column.<br>
                Paper chromatography -is an analytical method used to separate colored chemicals or substances. In analytical chemistry, technique for separating dissolved chemical substances by taking advantage of their different rates of migration across sheets of paper. It is an inexpensive but powerful analytical tool that requires very small quantities of material.<br>
                High-performance liquid chromatography - is a technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. It relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material. Each component in the sample interacts slightly differently with the adsorbent material, causing different flow rates for the different components and leading to the separation of the components as they flow out the column. HPLC has been used for manufacturing during the production process of pharmaceutical and biological products, detecting performance enhancement drugs in urine.</p>

It's a measure of the electrical charge of particles are that are suspended in liquid. In colloids, zeta potential is the electric potential difference across the ionic layer around a charged colloid ion. Put another way, it's the potential in the interface double layer at the slipping plane. Typically, the higher the zeta-potential, the more stable the colloid. Zeta potential that are less negative than -15 mV typically represents the beginnings of agglomeration of particles. When the zeta-potential equals zero, the colloid will precipitate into a solid.<br>
                Electrophoresis- is a technique commonly used in the lab to separate charged molecules, like DNA, according to size The migration of charged colloidal particles or molecules through a stationary medium under the influence of an applied electric field usually provided by immersed electrodes.

                    Application of chromatography in biology and medicine.</b> </p>

            <p>Chromatography is a physiochemical method of analysis and separarion of components of a mixture, based of their different distribution between two phases, on which is immobile (solid or liquid) and the other is mobile (gas or liquid), filtered through the immobile phase. <br>
                Acording to the aggregate state of phases, mobile and immobile (its it also called the stationary phase), gas and liquid types of chromatography are distinguished. &#96; <br>
                The mobile phase in gas chromatography is a gas carrier (hydrogen, helium, argon, nitrogen), to which a gaseous or vaporous mixture of analyzed substances is added. The immobile phase may be a non-volatile liquid (glycerin, polyethylene glycol), which is spread on a solid inert adsorbent (solid carrier). <br>
                The presence of components is the current gas carrier that goes out from the column is registered by a detector. Signals of the detector are written down as a chromatogram by an automatic potentiomer. A separate peak corresponds to each of the mixture components on the chromatogram. Modern detecors allow recording even 10-12 g of a substane. The described variety of gas chromatography is called gas-liguid chromatography, and the instrument that analyzes a mixture is named a gas chromatography. <br>
                If a solid adsorbent, not a liquid, is used as an immobile phase instead of a liquid, then such variant of chromatography is named gas adsorpion chromatography. As to liquid chromatography, a liquid is used as a mobile phase in this case, and the immobile phase is a liquid that is bounded to an inert solid support or a solid. Among liquid chromatography varieties of special sttention, according to medical and biological practise, in the method of high-performance liquid chromatography. In this method a mobile phase is a specially selected mixture of solvents which is introduced at a high pressure into a chromatographic column. Various chromatographic methods are also classified according to the technique of mixture components separation. There are may be column, capillary or planar chromatography. In column chromatography a mobile phase is passed through an immobile phase that fills the column. Capillary chromatpgraphy is based on the use a capillaries, in which a liquid immobile phase is applied to their inner walls and a mobile phase passed through it. In paper chromatography separation of a components mixture, which is in the liquid phase, takes place on a special prepared paper. Thin-layer chromatography is based on the use of a thin layer of solid material that is separed on a chromatographic plate made of an inert material (glass, aluminium, foil). Depending on the dominant mechanism of the process of mixture components separation, the chromatographic methods may be classified as : adsorption, partition, ion exchange, gel permeation, afiinity and thermochromatography. The essence of adsorption chromatography consist in separation of substances of mixtures based on their different adsorbability on that or another adsorbent. Ion exchange chromatogaphy is based a different ability of ions that are in the analyzed mixture to exchange with ions that enter into the composition of an ion exchanger. Separation of mixtures into their components by gel permeation chromatography, which is also called size exclusion or molecular sieve chromatography, is based on the different ability of substances to penetrate into porres of a gel that plays a role of the mobille phase. Afiinity chromatography is based on the abilities of some compounds to in a solution only their substances and to interact with them. Precipitation chromatography is based on a difference in the solubility of precipitates which are obtained as a result to chemical interaction of mixture components with a substance of the immobile phase. A chromatogram of human body metabolites gives a possibility to establish the type of microorganisms that have produced a disease. Chromatography has a great role in the diagnosis of congenital and acquired metabolism dysfunction, such as diabetes mellitus, podagra and other sidease. Chromatographic research of the lipid content in the blood have promoted the determination of the causes of origin, ways of prophylaxis and treatment of atherosclerosis, which is a disease that leads to the development if ischemic heart disease, disturbance of blood circulation in the brain. </p>

            <p>Colloids with the continuous phase in the form of a liquid liozole. Aggregation is the process or the result of the formation of aggregates. Combining the dispersed phase may occur under the influence of added electrolyte, any fillers (finely divided solid phase) and a temperature or due to chemical reactions in the mixture, under the influence of external factors. The rate of coagulation is determined by the Brownian motion, the intensity of which is conditioned by the concentration of the dispersed phase and the rate of diffusion in the liquid, which in turn is strongly dependent on temperature. Coagulation kinetics are also influenced by interactions, which can be adjusted composition of the electrolyte system. There are two types of life of colloidal systems - kinetic and aggregation. The kinetic stability is associated with resistance to coagulation due to the force. Counteract the Brownian motion. Aggregation stability is related to the immune system to create larger aggregates. Colloidal their stability is due to repulsion of the particles, which measure is called. zeta potential. When this potential is decreasing, it is increasing the rate of coagulation. With a small zeta potential, called the critical potential, begins rapid coagulation. In the case of the electrolyte potential it does not depend on its chemical structure, but on their charge. May accelerate coagulation of external factors, such as mixing, sonication, centrifugation. Coagulation caused by mechanical external factors is called coagulation assisted. On the other hand, coagulation caused by the same Brownian motion is called. coagulation perikinetyczna. During slow coagulation of only a portion of collisions resulting from Brownian motion of the particles of the disperse phase leads to connect. The rapid coagulation - all. To create units, the particles must have a kinetic energy exceeding the energy resulting from adverse interactions. Lyophilic colloids are stabilized by forming shells around the dispersed particles solvated. Operation of the electrolyte involves rupturing the shells. Adding to the colloid electrolyte lipophilic is called. salting. Salting-out does not always lead to the precipitation of solid aggregates. Sometimes they arise by coacervation, liquid droplets. Rule Hardy-Schultze, on colloids liofobowych, it states that the effect of coagulation of ions with a double charge is 80 times greater than with only one elementary charge and approx. 640 times smaller than the ion-laden triple. The opacity quantification method provides a fast and reproducible estimate of the coagulation threshold temperature of transparent temperature-sensitive gel phantoms. The temperatures determined using this method were well within the range of temperatures estimated using MR-thermometry. Due to the specific heating capabilities of the PCR machine, and the robust determination of coagulation threshold temperatures based on the statistically significant increase in the opacity of gel samples, coagulation temperatures can be determined more precisely and with less variability compared to MRI-based methods. or the electrokinetic potential. Second, the charged unit atrracts an oppositely charged atmosphere of mobile ions. The inner shell of charge and the outer ionic atmosphere is called the electric double layer.&#1040; major source of kinetic stability of colloids is the existence of an electric charge on the surfaces of the particles. On the account of this charge, ions of opposite charge tend to cluster nearby, and an ionic atmosphere is formed. Two regions of charge must be distinguished. First, there is &#1072; fairly immobile layer of ions that adhere tightly to the surface of the colloidal particle, and which may include water molecules (if that is the support medium). The radius of the sphere that captures this rigid layer is called the radius of shear, and is the major factor determining the mobility of the particles. The electric potential at the radius of shear relative to its value in the distant, bulk medium is called the zeta potential Stability of colloidal sols. Electrical charge on colloidal particles. The stability of &#1072; colloidal solution is due to the fact that the colloidal particles the sol are electrically charged. The particles, therefore, repel one another and do not coalesce (come close together) to form large non-colloidal particles. Colloidal particles carry either positive or negative charge. All the dispersed particles in &#1072; colloidal solution carry the same charge while the dispersion medium has an equal and opposite charge. For example, arsenious sulphide particles are negatively charged whereas the dispersion medium (water) is positively charged. Ferric hydroxide particles are positively charged whereas the dispersion medium (water) is negatively charged.</p>

                Schulze&ndash;Hardy rule The generalization that the critical coagulation concentration for a typical lyophobic sol is extremely sensitive to the valence of the counter-ions (high valence gives a low critical coagulation concentration).<br>
                In coagulation, we add a chemical such as alum which produces positive charges to neutralize the negative charges on the particles. Then the particles can stick together, forming larger particles which are more easily removed. The coagulation process involves the addition of the chemical (e.g. alum) and then a rapid mixing to dissolve the chemical and distribute it evenly throughout the water.<br>
                Structural - mechanical factor of soils stabilization by the addi tion of some amount of high - molecular weight compounds is called a colloidal protection.

            <p>Coarse dispersion (Suspension), Colloid and sollution Structure and Properties of Dispersions It is still common belief, that dispersions basically do not display any structure, i.e., the particles (or in case of emulsions: droplets) dispersed in the liquid or solid matrix (the &quot;dispersion medium&quot;) are assumed to be statistically distributed. Therefore, for dispersions usually percolation theory is assumed to appropriately describe their properties. <br>
                In the following, only such dispersions will be discussed with a dispersed phase diameter of less than 1 &micro;m. To understand the formation and properties of such dispersions (incl emulsions), it must be considered, that the dispersed phase exhibits a &quot;surface&quot;, which is covered (&quot;wet&quot;) by a different &quot;surface&quot; which hence are forming an interface (chemistry). Both surfaces have to be created (which requires a huge amount of energy), and the interfacial tension (difference of surface tension) is not compensating the energy input, if at all. Dispersion is a process by which (in the case of solids becoming dispersed in a liquid) agglomerated particles are separated from each other and a new interface, between an inner surface of the liquid dispersion medium and the surface of the particles to be dispersed, is generatedIn chemistry, a suspension is a heterogeneous mixture containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Usually they must be larger than 1 micrometer. The internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents. Unlike colloids, suspensions will eventually settle. An example of a suspension would be sand in water. The suspended particles are visible under a microscope and will settle over time if left undisturbed. This distinguishes a suspension from a colloid, in which the suspended particles are smaller and do not settle. Colloids and suspensions are different from solutions, in which the dissolved substance (solute) does not exist as a solid, and solvent and solute are homogeneously mixed. A suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas is called an aerosol or particulate. In the atmosphere these consist of fine dust and soot particles, sea salt, biogenic and volcanogenic sulfates, nitrates, and cloud droplets. <br>
                Suspensions are classified on the basis of the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, where the former is essentially solid while the latter may either be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. <br>
                In modern chemical process industries, high shear mixing technology has been used to create many novel suspensions. <br>
                Size Classification of Suspensions A pharmaceutical suspension is a coarse dispersion in which insoluble solid particles are suspended in a liquid medium. <br>
                A coarse suspension is a dispersion of finely divided, insoluble solid particles (the disperse phase) in a liquid (the dispersion medium). Most pharmaceutical suspensions consist of an aqueous dispersion medium although in some instances it may be an organic or oily liquid. A disperse phase with a mean diameter of up to 1 mm is usually termed a colloidal dispersion and include such examples as aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide suspensions. <br>
                A solid in liquid dispersion in which the particles are above colloidal size is termed a coarse suspension. <br>

                Comparing suspensions with solutions: The solution is considered to be the most bioavilable liquid dosage form. Although also a liquid, the suspension has a dissolution step. However, relative to solid dosage forms, the suspension offers two advantages: <br>
                &bull; Drug particle size must be small to avoid a gritty mouth-feel. <br>
                &bull; All solid particles must be wetted to achieve physical stability. <br>
                Suspensions may be defined as preparations containing finely divided drug particles (between 1 and 50 micrometers in diameter) distributed uniformly throughout a fluid or semisolid vehicle. These particles are large enough to sediment under the influence of gravity. A well-made commercial suspension will have additional ingredients called excipients that act to improve the stability of the dispersion. The suspension should settle slowly, be readily redispersed upon gentle shaking, pour readily and maintain the particle size of the ingredients throughout long periods of storage. Extemporaneously prepared suspensions should also have these same characteristics. The lone difference being that they do not have to be stable for as long a period of time as they are made by a pharmacist for immediate use on a specific patient. Emulsions An emulsion is a dispersion in which the dispersed phase is composed of small globules of a liquid distributed throughout a vehicle in which it is immiscible. Because of the large increase in surface free energy caused in the production of an emulsion the use of surfactants or flim formers is important as a way to Ustabilize the product. Surfactants lower the interfacial tension between the oil and water. This lowers the amount of energy needed to form the emulsion. The surfactant also forms a rigid film over the globules preventing them from coming together after they are formed. Material used for this purpose include carbohydrates such as acacia, protein such as gelatin, cholesterol from egg yolk, finely divided powder such as bentonite, and surfactants such as Tween and Span.</p>

            <p>Macromolecular colloid: when certain substances having big size molecules and large molecular masses, called macro-molecules, are dissolved in &#1072; suitable liquid, they form &#1072; solution in which the molecules of the substance in the dispersed particles have size in the colloidal range. These macromolecular substances are usually polymers with very high molecular masses. Examples of naturally occurring macromolecules are starch, cellulose, proteins, enzymes and gelatin. Examples of man-made macromolecules are polyethylene, nylon, polystyrene, synthetic rubber, etc. As these molecules have large sizes and have dimensions comparable to those of colloidal particles, their dispersions are called macromolecular colloids. Their colloidal solutions are quite stable and resemble true solutions in many respects. <br>
                The high molecular compounds are compounds, which have 10.000 - 10.000.000 Da molecular mass. Swelling it is process solubility high-molecular compound(HMC) in solvent. Swelling is an usual phenomenon of interaction of a polymer with solvent. Insertion of such liquid within polymer matrix tend to swell it. This could be either reversible or irreversible. Many times, some polymer have a tendency to absorb moisture which tend to change the associated properties. the total moisture insertion is not always reversible. A certain fraction forms a part the polymer matrix. Shortly speaking the increase of volume of material due to absorption of a solvent, common for polymers<br>
                Important factors which affect on dissolution ofmacromolecular compounds are: temperature,polarity, molecular weight, branching, crosslinking degree, and crystallinity.Additionally the porosity of polymeric specimens is a dominant factor that controls their swelling behaviour. Increased porosity leads to fast initial rates of weight uptake and high extent of equilibrium swelling Molecular weight of polymers plays an important role in their solubility. Molecular size of polymer solutes is much bigger than that of the solvent. In the dissolution process such molecules swell appreciably, restricting their mobility, and consequently the intermolecular friction increases. The solution in these cases, becomes highly viscous. <br>
                Thanks to that processes our natural polymers- proteins cas dissolute in water creating hydrogel which build our internal organs and muscles. What is more RNA and DNA contains polymer backbones which are based on sugar units. Also enzymes and chitin have them.</p>

            <p>Starch gelatinization is a process of breaking down the intermolecular bonds of starch molecules in the presence of water and heat, allowing the hydrogen bonding sites (the hydroxyl hydrogen and oxygen) to engage more water. This irreversibly dissolves the starch granule in water. Water acts as a plasticizer.<br>
                Three main processes happen to the starch granule: granule swelling, crystal or double helical melting, and amylose leaching.<br>
                &#61558;During heating, water is first absorbed in the amorphous space of starch, which leads to a swelling phenomenon.<br>
                &#61558;Water then enters via amorphous regions the tightly bound areas of double helical structures of amylopectin. At ambient temperatures these crystalline regions do not allow water to enter. Heat causes such regions to become diffuse, the amylose chains begin to dissolve, to separate into an amorphous form and the number and size of crystalline regions decreases. Under the microscope in polarized light starch loses its birefringence and its extinction cross. <br>
                &#61558;Penetration of water thus increases the randomness in the starch granule structure, and causes swelling, eventually soluble amylose molecules leach into the surrounding water and the granule structure disintegrates.<br>
                As far as the gels are concerned they are solid jelly-like material that can have properties ranging from soft and weak to hard and tough. Gels are defined as a substantially dilute cross-linked system (cross-link is a bond that links one polymer chain to another), which exhibits no flow when in the steady-state. Many gels display thixotropy &ndash; they become fluid when agitated, but resolidify when resting. Each gel molecule could be considered as a dilute solution. The strength and flexibility of gels increases with the crosslinking degree. We distinguish hydrogel, organogels, xerogels, Nanocomposite hydrogels and covalent gels.<br>
                Gelatin, which is used in food and industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed. Collagen also has many medical uses in treating complications of the bones and skin.<br></p>

            <p>1. How to prepare 200 mL of solution with molar concentration Cm(Na2CO3) = 0,05<br>
                mol/L, if we have a dry sodium carbonate Na2CO3 in laboratory?<br>
                Odp 1: 200mL solution= 0.2L , Cm= 0.05 mol/l<br>
                MNa2Co3= 2x23+12+3x16=106g/mol<br>
                Cm= n/v n= Cm x V n+=0.05mol/l x 0.2L= 0.01 mola<br>
                1mol &ndash; 106g<br>
                0.01mol &ndash; x<br>
                X= 1.06g<br>
                We must take 1.06g dry sodium carbonate and dissolved this in to 200mL of water.</p>

            <p>2. How many grams of water are required to add to 200 g of 98% sulfuric acid solution<br>
                for obtaining a solution with a mass fraction of acid 20%<br>
                Odp 2:<br>
                Sulfuric acid: H2SO4 200g of 98% H2SO4 ! and we need Cp: 20%<br>
                200g of 98% H2SO4<br>
                Mr= 200g Cp-95%<br>
                Cp= (ms/mr) x 100% -> ms = Cp x mr / 100%<br>
                Ms= 98%x200g/100%=198g H2SO4(200g of 98% solution, so in 200g we have 198g H2S04 and<br>
                4gH2O)<br>
                Cp-> 20%<br>
                mr = (ms x 100%)/Cp<br>
                mr= 196g x 100%/ 20% = 980<br>
                mr= ms + mh20 -> MH2O= mr-ms = 980g &ndash; 196g=784g h20<br>
                so we must add 784g &ndash; 4g = 780g of H2O (because this 4g H2O is already in the solution)</p>

            <p>3. Calculate &#916;Tf of solution, containing in 125 g of water 27 g of glucose.<br>
                Freezingpoint depression constant (for water) kf = 1,86.<br>
                If the solution is treated as an ideal solution, the extent of freezing-point depression<br>
                depends only on the solute concentration that can be estimated by a simple linear<br>
                relationship with the cryoscopic constant (&quot;Blagden's Law&quot;):<br>
                &#916;TF = KF &middot; b &middot; i,<br>
                where:<br>
                &bull; &#916;TF, the freezing-point depression<br>
                &bull; KF, the cryoscopic constant, which is dependent on the properties of the solvent,<br>
                not the solute. (Note: When conducting experiments, a higher KF value makes it<br>
                easier to observe larger drops in the freezing point.<br>
                &bull; b is the molality (moles solute per kilogram of solvent)<br>
                &bull; i is the van 't Hoff factor (number of ion particles per individual molecule of solute,<br>
                e.g. i = 2 for NaCl, 3 for BaCl2).<br>
                Glucose = C6H12O6 =van&rsquo;t hoff factor = 24<br>
                Molarity(mol/kg)<br>
                125g= 0.125Kg<br>
                Mc6h1206= 180g &ndash; 1 mol<br>
                We have 27g<br>
                180g &ndash; 1mol<br>
                27g &ndash; x<br>
                X=0.15 mola glucose<br>
                M= 0.15mola/0.125kg = 1.2mola/kg<br>
                &#916;Tf = 1.86 KxKg/mol x 1.2mola/kg x 24 = 53.57 K<br>
                So freezing point depression is equal 53.57 K</p>

            <p>4. Calculate the osmotic pressure of 0.1 M urea solution at temperature 25&#1086;&#1057;=<br>
                298.15K .<br>
                &#928;= MRT<br>
                where M- molar concentration , T- temperature in Kelvins and R is gas constant = R = 8.31<br>
                J/mol x K<br>
                &#928; = 0.1 mola/L x 8.31 J/ mol x K x 298.15K = 247.76 J/L<br>
                Osmotic pressure is equal = 247.76 J/L<br></p>
            <p>5. To the patient with body mass 80 kg need to enter 0.1% adrenaline solution in<br>
                concentration of 0.5 mg/kg. How many grams of solution are necessary for<br>
                administration?<br>
                Body mass = 80kg<br>
                0.1% adrenaline &ndash; 0.5mg/kg<br>
                So if 0.5mg/kg -> 0.5mg x 80kg = 40mg<br>
                Necessary for administration is 40 mg of 0.1% adrenaline solution<br></p>
            <p>6. To calculate the pH of the sulfuric acid solution with molar concentration 0.002<br>
                mol/l.<br>
                H2S04 -> 2H+ + SO42-<br>
                0.002 -> 0.004 + 0.002<br>
                M[H+] = 0.004 mol/l<br>
                pH= - log [H+] = -log [0.004] = 2.4<br>
                ph is equal 2.4 (strong acid)</p>

            <p>7. To calculate the pOH, concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions in a solution<br>
                with pH = 7.2.<br>
                pH + pOH = 14 --> pOH = 14 &ndash; pH = 14 &ndash; 7.2 6.8<br>
                ph= 7.2 so [H+]=10^-ph= 10^(-7.2) = 0.0000000631 =6.31 x 10^-8 mol/l<br>
                pOH= 6.8 so [OH-]= 10^-pOH= 10^(-6.8)= 0.0000001585= 1.59 x 10^-7 mol/l</p>

            <p>8. To calculate a volume of hydrochloric acid solution with mass fraction 0,04 and<br>
                density 1,018 g/ml, which necessary for making 250 ml of 0,1 mol/l HCl solution.</p>

            <p>9. To calculate mass of Na2CO3 in solution, if used 22,00 ml of solution H2C2O4 which<br>

                Na2C03 + H2C2O4 ! H2CO3 + Na2C2O4<br>
                M Na2CO3 = 2x23 + 12 + 3x 16 = 106 g/mol<br>
                M H2C2O4 = 2x1 + 2 x 12 + 4 x 16 = 90 g/mol<br>
                We used 22 ml of 0.12 mol/l H2C2O4 -> M= n/v -> n= M x V = 0.12 x 0.022l = 0.00264 mol<br>
                To titration one mole of Na2CO3 we need one mole of H2C2O4. So we also need 0.00264<br>
                mol Na2CO3<br>
                So of 1 mol of Na2CO3 is 106 g. 0.00264 x 106 = 0.28 g ( mass of Na2CO3 in solution)</p>

            <p>10. 0,05 M solution of acetic acid and 0,05 M sodium acetic solution equal volumes has<br>

                Sodium acetic &ndash; CH3COONa<br>
                pH = pKa + log [salt]/[acid]<br>
                pH = 4.73 + log 0.05/0.05 = 4.73 + 0 = 4.73<br>
                pH = 4.73<br></p>

            <p>11. To calculate pH of an acetic buffer solution which components ratio has been<br>
                [CH3OOH] :[CHCOO-] = 2 : 3 (pKa = 4.73)<br>
                pH = pKa + log [salt]/[acid]<br>
                pH = 4.73 + log 3/2 = 4.73 +0.18 = 4.91<br>
                pH=4.91<br></p>
